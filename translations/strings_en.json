Ahh it could've been nice...<br><br>        Anyway, COVID had some other plans for all of us and long story short not only did these        plans fail but our summer seaside holiday too.<br>        I still have some countries on my bucket list and Italy has always been at the top!<br>        After quite some thinking I settled on a northern Italy, 3 week roadtrip with hopefully        one of my favourite cars.",
