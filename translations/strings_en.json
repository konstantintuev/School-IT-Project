  "intro_text": "I have been in love with Italy as long as I remember.<br>        The architecture, the people, the music, the vibe...<br><br>        Consequently April 2020 was the most anticipated month ever for me!<br>        My family after quite some convincing decided that finally we will take the so long awaited        northern Italy roadtrip - stay in a few different places and travel with a small compact car        in arguably the perfect month for travel in Italy. Ahh it could've been nice...<br><br>        Anyway, COVID had some other plans for all of us and long story short not only did these        plans fail but our summer seaside holiday too.<br>        I still have some countries on my bucket list and Italy has always been at the top!<br>        After quite some thinking I settled on a northern Italy, 3 week roadtrip with hopefully        one of my favourite cars.",
